## Styleguides 👔

### Code Structure

When contributing to the Energy project, we value code quality and maintainability. While Nim offers powerful metaprogramming features such as macros and templates, we encourage contributors to exercise caution when using them. By minimizing the use of macros and templates, we prioritize code readability and maintainability. Our goal is to build a set of reliable libraries that are easy to understand, extend, and improve upon. While macros and templates can be valuable in certain scenarios, we encourage contributors to consider their long-term impact on the project and opt for simpler, more straightforward solutions whenever possible.

### Code Styleguide

We use the [style standard from status.io](https://status-im.github.io/nim-style-guide/)
